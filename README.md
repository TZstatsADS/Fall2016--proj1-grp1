+ Project summary: Our project focused on job recommendation according to four interesting chosen factors, including arrival time for work, location, working hours and commuting means. We investigated their effects on income respectively and helped make a job-decision for your reference. Thus, our team has dug into the relations between following factors:

Part 2. Arrival Time vs. Occupation: We compared different occupations' arrival time for work and used bubble plots to show different occupations' median arrival time and median income together.

Part 3. Location vs. Occupation: We explored the difference in income and employees' number of different occupations in each states.

Part 4. Transportation vs. Occupation: We showed that people who do certain jobs and commute to work in a certain way earn more.

Part 5. Working Hours vs. Occupation: We analyzed how working hour affected different occupations' salaries.
