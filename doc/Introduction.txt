Our project focused on job recommendation according to four interesting factors, arrival time for work, location, working hours and the way they get to job. 
We investigated their effects on income respectively and help you make job-decision.

First, our group explored the the relation of arrival time for work and income. We compared different occupations' arrival time for work and used
bubble plot to show the relation of occupation, arrival time and income.

Then we looked into the population of different occupation and their income in each states, picking up the top 5 and lowest 5.  

In the third part, the heatmap implied that people's transportion preferences may reflect their income situations. And the treemap
help to figure out traveling in which way and which job is most profitable.

Finally, we seeked the interconnection of working hours, occupations and salaries.
